#Goal
## To understand the relationship between population and the number of confirmed cases

## Data

First, let's import the data. The data is coming from two sources: the population csv and the total cases csv. 

```{r cars, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
covid <- read.csv("~/Documents/CU Boulder Codes/Final Exam Codes/covid.csv")
covid_pop <- read.csv("~/Documents/CU Boulder Codes/Final Exam Codes/COVID_time.csv")
covid_pop <- covid_pop[,12:13]
covid_tot <- merge(covid, covid_pop, by = "Combined_Key")
```

## Aggregation and Editing of Data

Then, this data is aggregated into another dataframe to show state data. This is then summed across.

```{r pressure2, echo=TRUE}
covid_state <- aggregate(covid_tot[10:16], 
                         by = list(covid_tot$Province_State), 
                         sum)

covid_state$Case_Pop_Ratio = covid_state$Confirmed / covid_state$Population

covid_state <- covid_state[!is.infinite(covid_state$Case_Pop_Ratio),]

covid_stateSort <- covid_state[order(-covid_state$Case_Pop_Ratio),]
```

## Plotting Cases vs. Population Data

```{r pressure3, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = covid_tot, aes(x = Population, y = Confirmed)) + 
      geom_point() + 
      labs(title = "Population vs. Cases for all Data")
```

In this plot, we can see that the majority of cases are clustered in the smaller regions with a few large scale points. It may be better to visualize this data on a log-log plot

```{r pressure4, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = covid_stateSort, aes(x = Population, y = Confirmed)) + 
       geom_point() + 
       labs(title = "Population vs. Cases for State Data (Log-Log Plot)") + 
       scale_y_log10() +
       scale_x_log10()
```

Much Better!

We can see that on the log-log plot of cases vs. population, the data follows a strong linear pattern. Let's put a regression line on top to see what the model looks like

```{r pressure5, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = covid_stateSort, aes(x = Population, y = Confirmed)) + 
       geom_point() + 
       labs(title = "Population vs. Cases for State Data (Log-Log Plot)") + 
       scale_y_log10() +
       scale_x_log10() + 
       geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

We see that the linear model seems to fit the data fairly well. Let's take a look at the model

```{r pressure6, echo=TRUE}
model <- lm(log(Confirmed) ~ log(Population), data = covid_stateSort)
summary(model)
```

In this model, we see a great R^2 Value and p-val. This displays that the model is strong and the model follows a format of <b>log(Cases) = log(Pop)*1.364 - 10.12</b>
